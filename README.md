This Arduino code is specifically designed to interface multiple VL53L0X time-of-flight distance sensors with an ArduPilot-based drone. It sequentially powers each sensor using separate shutdown (XSHUT) pins and assigns a unique I2C address to each sensor to avoid address conflicts on the bus. These new addresses must be configured in ArduPilotâ€™s proximity sensor address parameters to enable the flight controller to correctly read distance data from all connected sensors.
